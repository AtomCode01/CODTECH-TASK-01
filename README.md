# Student Performance Indicator

## Objective
This project aims to analyze how various factors such as gender, ethnicity, parental level of education, lunch type, and test preparation courses influence students' performance (test scores).

---

## Key Activities
1. **Understanding the Problem Statement**: Defining the scope and objectives of the analysis.
2. **Data Collection**:
   - Dataset Source: [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/spscientist/students-performance-in-exams)
   - Dataset Size: 8 columns and 1000 rows.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Statistical summaries of numerical features.
   - Visualizations to identify trends and patterns.
   - Comparative analysis across different demographic groups.
4. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handling missing values, if any.
   - Preparing data for visualizations and insights generation.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Primary programming language.
- Libraries:
  - `pandas` for data manipulation and analysis.
  - `numpy` for numerical computations.
  - `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for visualizations.

## Key Insights
1. **Performance Overview**:
   - Mean test scores are consistent across subjects, ranging between 66 and 68.
   - Standard deviations for scores are close, between 14.6 and 15.19.

2. **Subject Performance**:
   - Students performed the worst in Mathematics and the best in Reading.

3. **Gender Analysis**:
   - Female students tend to outperform male students overall.

4. **Impact of Lunch Type**:
   - Students with standard lunch performed significantly better than those with reduced lunch.

5. **Parental Education**:
   - Parental education level does not generally correlate with better performance, except for males whose parents have an associate's or master's degree.
